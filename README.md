# Pug-Bounce-App


[Check out site here](https://josephlindzius.github.io/pug-bounce/index.html)

## Information

I created this using Three.js and the great tutorials.  Added a bit to the example script to produce my bouncing pugs.  The trees and bugs are sprites thus always focused on the camera.

## Bugs

Still need to animate mesh she is there in back just for fun.
